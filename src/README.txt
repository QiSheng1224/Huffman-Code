4. What is the runtime youâ€™re claiming for your CodeBook methods (contains and getSequence)?
(use n = the number of characters in the codebook.)
    My CodeBook is a hash table that is using chaining since both method depends on the size of the buckets
    and has nothing to do with the n. I conclude both method run in O(1) as the average running time.
5. What is the runtime of the HuffmanCodeTree.decode method, use b =the number of bits in
the binarySequence. (I.E. your answer should not include n at all.)
    
    ANS: It runs in O(b). since I have to get every bit in the binarySequence.
